This adventure game is set in a room with a door on each of the four sides of the room. The goal of the game is to escape from the room.

The player has to visit each of the four doors, which are each "locked" by a guard, and answer a riddle to open the door.

Behind three of the doors is an object that the player can use to escape. The player must collect all three items to be able to escape.

Behind the fourth door is "hidden" door, which the player discovers by decoding a sign on the hidden door with one of the items collected.

The decoded sign tells the player what to do next, which is to use another item to shrink. 

Once the player has shrunk, they encounter a small door which they can use their last item to open.

The game ends when the player goes through the small door, escaping the riddle room.
